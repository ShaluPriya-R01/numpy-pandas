## Aggregation operations
  Aggregation operations such as finding the maximum and minimum values in an array are common tasks in data analysis and numerical computing. NumPy provides convenient functions like max() and min() for these operations, along with utilities like np.ones() and np.zeros() for creating arrays with specific values.

## Slicing Operations
  Slicing operations allow for selecting specific portions of an array. NumPy supports slicing using standard Python syntax, enabling users to extract subsets of data efficiently.

## Broadcasting Operations
  Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform element-wise operations on arrays with different shapes. It automatically adjusts the shape of arrays to make their dimensions compatible for operations, simplifying array arithmetic.

## Array Manipulation
  Array manipulation operations include reshaping, flattening, and concatenating arrays. These operations are useful for transforming arrays to match the required format for various computations or data processing tasks.

## Array Comparison
  NumPy supports element-wise comparison of arrays using comparison operators like >, <, ==, etc. This allows for logical operations and filtering based on specific conditions.

## Array Indexing and Fancy Indexing
  NumPy provides versatile indexing capabilities, including basic indexing, slicing, and fancy indexing. Fancy indexing allows for selecting elements using arrays of indices, providing flexibility in data manipulation and analysis.

## Mathematical Functions
  NumPy offers a wide range of mathematical functions for element-wise operations on arrays. These functions include trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), exponential and logarithmic functions, and more, enabling complex mathematical computations with ease.
## Linear Algebra
  NumPy provides comprehensive support for linear algebra operations, including matrix multiplication, determinant calculation, eigenvalue decomposition, and solving linear equations. These functionalities are essential for various scientific and engineering applications.

## Statistics
  NumPy offers functions for statistical calculations, such as computing mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of arrays. These functions facilitate data analysis and summarization, providing insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data.

## Random Sampling
  NumPy provides utilities for generating random numbers and random samples from different probability distributions. Random sampling is useful for simulations, statistical modeling, and generating synthetic data for testing and experimentation.

## Image Processing with Python
  This contains Python code for performing various image processing tasks using the NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image libraries. The code includes functions for slicing images into red, green, and blue channels, converting images to grayscale, visualizing histograms of pixel intensity distributions, applying Gaussian blur and Sobel edge detection, and enhancing contrast.
## Code Overview
  Import Necessary Libraries: Import required libraries including NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Load Image: Load the image(s) using skimage.io.imread() function. Slicing Image into Red, Green, and Blue Channels: Separate the image into its red, green, and blue channels using NumPy array slicing. Convert Image to Grayscale: Convert the image to grayscale using skimage.color.rgb2gray() function. Visualize Grayscale Image: Display the grayscale image using Matplotlib. Histograms of Pixel Intensity Distributions: Plot histograms of pixel intensity distributions for each channel and the grayscale image using Matplotlib. Apply Gaussian Blur and Sobel Edge Detection: Apply Gaussian blur and Sobel edge detection to the original image using functions from skimage.filters module. Enhance Contrast of Grayscale Image: Enhance the contrast of the grayscale image using histogram equalization (skimage.exposure.equalize_hist()).

## Example
  The provided code demonstrates how to perform various image processing tasks such as channel slicing, grayscale conversion, histogram visualization, edge detection, and contrast enhancement. It serves as a useful reference for understanding and implementing image processing algorithms in Python.
